// I mark variables that should, with some level of preference, stay
// the same. I have one method with zero inputs and one output, which
// does nothing. Planners may exploit the fact that, if I am
// satisfied, my output will not change during plan execution. This is
// called "stay optimization".

class StayConstraint(  // Install a stay constraint with the given strength on the given variable.
